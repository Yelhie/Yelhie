## About me

Hello everyone !
I'm Maëlle, a software Developer.

My expertise is focused on the TypeScript and Python ecosystems, with significant experience in developing SaaS (Software as a Service) applications using Angular. I also use Python for its versatility in scripting, automation, cybersecurity, data science, as well as data management and processing. It’s a great complement to JavaScript.
